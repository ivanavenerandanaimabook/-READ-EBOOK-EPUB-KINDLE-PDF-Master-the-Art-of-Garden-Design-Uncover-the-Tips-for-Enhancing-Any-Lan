Title: Plan ‚Äì Design ‚Äì Water ‚Äì Grow your new garden, from the ground up!

You have a yard now and you are not happy! Well, there is an answer to your dilemma. Check out ‚ÄúMaster the Art of Garden Design.‚Äù This book will give you the low down from the paper design to the soil types, on to the plants. This part is especially important to the design and the author goes over in detail, not only size, region, depth, water, but also colors. The most important part is one that not many authors explain while they tell you how and what to do, and that is the fact that you need to be aware of where the water you use to water your newly designed garden will end up when it runs off. For that matter for when it rains, where does all that water end up? You certainly would not want water to end up on the foundation of your home or any other buildings on your property. She even gives you photos, explicit directions, and many hints that help you accomplish your goals.

Most authors tell you to check your region but more importantly is the number of plants that you use in your wonderful design. Now on to how to enjoy that garden after all the major decisions of which and where to plant. You will need to think about the hardscape, walkways, seating, and decorations that go into a pleasing design. Now would be the time that you would love to be able to sit out there and take a deep breath of all the fragrances that you worked so hard to plant. Kate will guide you with suggestions to this area and she even tells you of the types of mistakes that she made on her first one.

Join Kate and walk through step by step on how to get what you want in your garden/landscape‚Ä¶

What did I like? Over the years I have read and reviewed books on gardening. Being in the Landscaping field myself in the past, I have a little experience. This book is more detailed than any that I have ever encountered before. I certainly would recommend anyone in using it as a guide to successfully create the look that you desire.

What will you like? Detailed, full of photos, easy directions, along with so many suggestions to succeed in your design. From the ground up is the best description I can give for this book, plus a list of the author‚Äôs own mistakes. I don‚Äôt think you can go wrong with this one.

Title: Excellent beginner book on creating a home landscape you'll love.
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 9, 2021
Review: I am an avid gardener. I love growing flowers, trees, shrubs, fruits and veggies. We have an acre of land and I have been slowly chipping away at adding more and more elements that make our property more beautiful and productive. Over the years, I've made a number of costly mistakes. Some of these have been an unavoidable part of learning, but if I would have had this book from the beginning, some of them could have been avoided.

I really love how the author gives many thought provoking questions that help you to think through what your goals and aspirations are for your home garden. She recommends trying to decide what is appealing to you by collecting photos of specific design elements and garden styles. She also mentions the importance of first getting to know what you are working with by making a careful walk through of your property and considering pitfalls you may need to work around or remove.

I found all of the information helpful and simple enough for even the beginning garden designer. The one thing I would really have liked to see though were many photos illustrating the concepts and steps that the author is trying to teach. (Thus the removing of one star.) Most of the photos in this book had little to do with the subject matter covered, nor were they inspirational. Solid illustrations of the principles taught could have elevated this book to 6 stars for the beginning garden designer.

Title: Tips and advice about landscaping for beginners designed to make any area come alive.
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 13, 2021
Review: The author talked me through the planning process, from ensuring you have the proper tools to being ok if you decide to change your design partway through the landscaping. The tone was conversational rather than preachy and not highly technical, which I appreciated. There were suggestions for softscaping with plants and hardscaping with architectural features as well as advice on the use of color.

I was all in when the author said that my new outdoor area should ‚Äúfeel like a sanctuary, a place where you can go to get fresh air and make the most incredible memories with the ones you love.‚Äù

I received an ARC from Reedsy Discovery.

Title: Very concise on decorating
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 23, 2021
Review: Covers all sorts of landscaping from start to finish. Includes technical and practical ideas on enhancing one's landscape. It gives a nice overview of all aspects of creating an inviting space in ones backyard. I have not read alot of landscape books but this seemed thorough. Not alot of "new" ideas and I prefer more photos of to help tie into the words--seeing the difference between a French garden/white garden vs a Spanish garden. Overall a good book for reference for the next landscape project.

Title: A wonderful resource for landscaping ideas
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 30, 2021
Review: When you live in the Southwest desert and are a water conservationist, creating a beautiful landscape is a bit different than if you live in the lush green areas of the Northeastern US. That's why so many gardening books fail me on several levels. Molina's book addresses all types of landscaping styles, types of soils, and different plants that adapt to different climates. She has solid information, great ideas, and I loved the photo examples. I particularly liked her Helpful Tips and Ideas chapter - there is a lot of information in this section that I can use in my own landscaping projects. So if you are just getting started, or if you want a new look for your current yard, I strongly recommend this book as a resource you will be using for many years to come.
